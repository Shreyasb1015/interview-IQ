pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies  
cd ../client
npm install
```

### **2. Start the Backend Server**

```bash
cd server-flask
python app_working.py
```

### **3. Start the Frontend**

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The client will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **Interview Flow:**

1. **Setup Phase:**
   - User selects difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
   - Chooses AI model (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Llama)
   - Picks interviewer persona
   - Selects interview type (Audio/Video)

2. **Interview Phase:**
   - System generates first contextual question
   - User provides audio response
   - Real-time speech analysis and feedback
   - Dynamic follow-up question generation
   - Continuous performance tracking

3. **Analysis Phase:**
   - Comprehensive speech quality analysis
   - Technical content evaluation
   - Performance scoring and insights
   - Improvement recommendations

### **AI Components:**

1. **Question Generator:**
   - 3-tier difficulty system
   - Subject-specific question banks
   - Persona-based question styling
   - Context-aware follow-ups

2. **Speech Analyzer:**
   - Filler word detection and counting
   - Speaking rate optimization
   - Confidence level assessment
   - Clarity and fluency scoring

3. **Feedback System:**
   - Real-time insights during interview
   - Post-answer comprehensive feedback
   - Performance trend analysis
   - Actionable improvement suggestions

## üîß **Configuration Options**

### **Interview Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  difficulty: "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard",
  llm: "ChatGPT" | "Claude" | "Gemini" | "Llama",
  interviewType: "audio" | "video",
  persona: "professional_man" | "professional_woman" | "friendly_mentor" | "strict_interviewer",
